I am grateful to have been given the chance to love you and to spend my days with you. I hope that on your birthday this year, all your dreams and wishes come true. I will always be by your side, supporting you, loving you, and celebrating every beautiful moment together.

Happy birthday, my love. I love you more than words can express. May this day be filled with love, happiness, and all the wonderful things you deserve.

With all my love,
